# Django API Test

I'm just playing with getting a simple JSON API endpoint up and running in Python/Django. So far, so good - pretty painless!

## Requirements

Not really requirements so much as what I just happened to be using, but:

- Python 3.4.3
- Django 1.8
- pyenv 20150326
- pip 6.1.1

## Usage

1. `$ python manage.py runserver`
2. Visit http://localhost:8000/time to get the time in a JSON response.
